// The session endpoints through the real Express stack.
//
// The controller tests build a `req` by hand, which is fast and blind in one
// specific way: they trust that the fake object looks like what the middleware
// chain actually produces. It does not always. In the previous task a test just
// like this one was the only thing that caught a 500 on *every* protected route
// — `cookie-parser` runs its own `JSONCookies` step and turns a value like `j:1`
// into the number `1` before anything downstream sees it, which no hand-built
// `req.cookies` ever does.
//
// So this file goes in through `supertest`: real cookie-parser, real
// `express.json`, real helmet, real `authenticate`, real `sessionStore`, real
// controllers. The only thing replaced is the handful of query methods on the
// two models, which means no Postgres and no fixture data — and, more to the
// point, it means the `where` clause the store hands the model is readable from
// here.
//
// That last part is what makes this the strongest test of the IDOR: `DELETE
// /api/auth/sessions/:id` is asserted not by trusting a mocked store's answer,
// but by reading the actual query and checking the caller's own `id_usuario` is
// in it.
